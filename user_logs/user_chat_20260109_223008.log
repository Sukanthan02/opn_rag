User (Session: session 8): i want to create document 
[ACTIVATED] Clarification (Progressive)
Assistant: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants to create a document. The matched agent is the Open Negotiation AI Agent's Document Creation Subagent. But the required parameters, client_name and wave_number, are missing. The rules say if the agent is identified but parameters are missing, ask for them directly. So I need to prompt the user for both client name and wave number. The example format shows a one-line acknowledgment followed by a request for the missing info. Let me check the example again. It says something like "I understand... To get that started, could you please tell me..." So I should structure it similarly. Make sure to mention both parameters. Also, keep it friendly and concise. Alright, I'll go with that.

I understand you want to create a document! To proceed, could you please provide the client name and the wave number?

[ACTIVATED] Query Validation (Rejected)
Assistant: I'm sorry, but I couldn't process your query. Query is too short to be meaningful

Please provide a clear question or request related to the available agents. You can ask 'What agents are available?' to see what I can help you with.

User (Session: session397824): i want to create document and send email for apollo 
[ACTIVATED] Clarification (Progressive)
Assistant: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants to create a document and send an email for Apollo. The required parameters are client_name and wave_number. The client_name is given as Apollo, but wave_number is missing. The agents identified are Document Creation and Email Sending under the Open Negotiation AI Agent.

First, check if all required parameters are present. Client name is there, but wave number is missing. So the next step is to ask for the wave number. The user hasn't provided that yet. The rules say if parameters are missing, ask directly. Since the agent is already identified (both subagents are relevant), but wave number is needed. So the response should acknowledge the request, mention needing the wave number. Also, since there are two subagents, maybe list them as options. Wait, the user already mentioned both actions, so maybe the agents are already selected, but the parameters are missing. Wait, the required parameters are client_name and wave_number. Client name is Apollo, wave number is missing. So the main thing is to get the wave number. However, the user might need to confirm which subagent to use first? Or maybe both subagents require the same parameters. The example for missing parameters says to ask for the missing info. Since the agents are already matched, but parameters are missing, the correct approach is to ask for the missing wave number. The user's query already specifies the actions, so maybe the agents are already selected. But the system needs to collect the missing parameter. So the output should be a one-line acknowledgment, then ask for the wave number. The example shows "could you please tell me the client name and wave number". Here, client name is already provided, so just ask for wave number. But the example might have both, but in this case, only wave number is missing. So the correct output is to ask for wave number. Also, check if the agents are already selected. The user mentioned both document creation and email sending, so maybe both subagents are needed. But the system needs to collect the wave number for both. So the response should be: "I understand you want to create a document and send an email for Apollo! To proceed, could you please provide the wave number?" That's concise, friendly, and clear. It asks for the missing parameter directly. The agents are already identified, so no need to list options. Just collect the wave number.

I understand you want to create a document and send an email for Apollo! To proceed, could you please provide the wave number?

User (Session: sessionqkjfjbd): i want to create document and send email 
[ACTIVATED] Clarification (Progressive)
Assistant: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants to create a document and send an email. The system has identified two subagents: Document Creation and Email Sending under the Open Negotiation AI Agent. The required parameters, client_name and wave_number, are missing.

First, I need to acknowledge their request. Then, check if the agents are already identified. Both subagents are under the same main agent, so maybe they don't need to choose between them since both are relevant. But the parameters are missing. The rules say if parameters are missing, ask for them directly. Since both are missing, I should prompt for client name and wave number. But wait, the example when parameters are missing says to ask for them specifically. So the response should be something like asking for client name and wave number. However, the user might need to select the agent first if everything is missing. But here, the agents are already identified. So the correct approach is to ask for the missing parameters. Let me make sure. The user's request is clear on the actions (create document and send email), and the agents are matched. The only missing pieces are the parameters. So the next step is to request those parameters. The example for missing parameters is the right path here. So the output should be a one-line acknowledgment followed by asking for client name and wave number. No need to list agents again since they are already identified. Alright, that makes sense.

User (Session: sessioewfwef): send email for apollo
[ACTIVATED] Clarification (Progressive)
Assistant: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user's query is "send email for apollo". The conversation history shows that the user mentioned "Apollo" as the client name. The matched candidates include the Open Negotiation AI Agent with the Email Sending Subagent. 

First, I need to check the required parameters: client_name and wave_number. The client_name is given as Apollo, but wave_number is missing. The user hasn't provided the wave number yet.

According to the rules, if an agent is identified but a parameter is missing, I should ask for the missing info directly. The user's request is to send an email, so the agent is already identified. The missing parameter here is wave_number. 

I should acknowledge their request, then ask specifically for the wave number. The example style for missing parameters says to mention the missing details. So the response should be something like, "I understand you want to send an email to Apollo! Could you please provide the wave number to proceed?" That's concise and friendly, and it directly asks for the missing parameter without exposing internal terms.

I understand you want to send an email to Apollo! Could you please provide the wave number to proceed?

User (Session: sessioewfwef): purpose of email agent
[ACTIVATED] Clarification (Progressive)
Assistant: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user mentioned "purpose of email agent". The matched candidate is the Open Negotiation AI Agent's Email Sending Agent. So the user is probably looking to send an email. The required parameters are client_name and wave_number, both missing.

First, I need to acknowledge their request. Then, since the agent is identified but parameters are missing, I should ask for those directly. The example style for missing parameters says to ask for them specifically. So the response should be something like, "I understand you want to send an email! To get that started, could you please tell me the client name and the wave number?" That's concise and friendly. I need to make sure not to mention any internal terms and keep it natural. Yep, that should work.
