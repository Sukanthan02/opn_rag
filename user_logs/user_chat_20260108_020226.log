Assistant: You're looking to create a document, which is a key part of our Open Negotiation workflow.

We can help generate various types of documents using our Document Creation Agent, tailored to your specific needs.

Could you provide more details about the kind of document you want to create and its purpose?

For example, you could tell me:
• Is this document for a new client?
• Are you looking to create a document that outlines negotiation terms?
