[ACTIVATED] Clarification (Vague Query Detection)
Assistant: Hi there! Thanks for reaching out about 'open negotiation'. I'm here to help make that process smooth for you.

Essentially, I can help manage the entire 'Open Negotiation' workflow, from checking your documents to sending out all the necessary communications and organizing everything afterward.

To make sure I'm on the right track, what are you hoping to accomplish with the open negotiation process today?

For example, you could tell me:
• Are you looking to start a new negotiation by preparing and sending out documents?
• Do you need to check the status of an ongoing negotiation?
• Perhaps you're interested in ensuring all the documents are correctly formatted before they go out?
• Or maybe you'd like to confirm that all the emails have been sent and filed properly?
