User (Session: session 6): i want to create document for apollo and wave 3
[ACTIVATED] Routing (Direct/Confirmed)
[ROUTED TO] Open Negotiation AI Agent/Document Creation Agent
Assistant: <think>
Okay, the user wants to create a document for Apollo and Wave 3. Let me break this down.

First, I need to acknowledge their request. They mentioned "create document for apollo and wave 3." So, the key points are document creation and the specific names Apollo and Wave 3. Maybe Apollo and Wave 3 are projects, products, or something specific to their context. I don't need to know the details, just confirm the intent.

Next, the routing is to the Document Creation Agent. The message needs to confirm that. The example messages show a structure: understanding the need, then routing. Also, keep it friendly and conversational. Avoid technical terms. 

Let me check the examples again. For "I need to send an email," the response was straightforward. Another example used "Great!" to start. Maybe start with "Got it!" or "Sure!" to keep it natural.

So, possible message: "I understand you need to create a document for Apollo and Wave 3. I'll connect you with the Document Creation Agent to help with that." 

Wait, the user wrote "apolllo" with two Ls? No, original query says "apollo" with one L. Should I mirror their spelling
