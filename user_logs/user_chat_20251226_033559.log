User (Session: mwjefbkbwqjk): i want to do open Negotiation 
[ACTIVATED] Clarification (Vague Query Detection)
Assistant: I can certainly help you with initiating the Open Negotiation process!

To get started, I need a little more information about what you'd like to do. The Open Negotiation process involves several steps, from checking your documents to sending out emails and organizing the files.

Are you looking to start the entire process from scratch, or do you have specific documents ready that you'd like to have checked first?

For example, you could tell me:
• Do you have the input files ready for quality checking?
• Are you looking to generate the negotiation documents?
• Would you like to proceed with sending out emails to clients?
