User (Session: default_session): which agent u suggest me for sending email 
[ACTIVATED] Agent Inquiry
Assistant: To send an email, I suggest using the Email Sending Agent. 

The Email Sending Agent has the capability for "email sending" and related tasks such as "email composition", "attachment association", "per-client email dispatch", and "email delivery execution". 

This agent can compose emails using validated metadata, attach the correct documents, send emails individually per client, and ensure accurate communication and record retention for every sent email.
