[ACTIVATED] Clarification (Vague Query Detection)
Assistant: You're looking to work with documents in the Open Negotiation workflow, but the specifics are unclear.

We can assist with various document-related tasks, from creation and validation to emailing and renaming, depending on your exact needs.

Are you trying to create new documents, validate existing ones, or handle them in some other way?

For example, you could tell me:
• Are you working with client-specific templates?
• Do you need to ensure document quality before proceeding?
